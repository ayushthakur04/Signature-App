# Signature Canvas Project

This project is a simple and interactive web application that allows users to create, customize, and save their digital signatures. Users can choose the color of the text, the background color of the canvas, and the thickness of the lines. They can also clear the canvas, save their signature as a PNG image, and retrieve previously saved signatures.

## Features

- **Draw Signature**: Draw your signature directly on the canvas using your mouse.
- **Text Color Picker**: Select the color of your signature from the color picker.
- **Background Color Picker**: Customize the background color of the canvas.
- **Line Thickness**: Choose the thickness of the signature lines using a dropdown menu.
- **Clear Canvas**: Clear the entire canvas with a single click.
- **Save & Download Signature**: Save your signature as a PNG file and download it to your device.
- **Retrieve Saved Signature**: Retrieve and display a previously saved signature from local storage (if available).

## Code Overview

### HTML

- The structure of the page is defined in the `index.html` file. It contains the main layout, including the canvas element, control buttons, and inputs for color picking and line thickness.

### CSS

- The styling is minimal and included within the `<style>` tags in the HTML file. It ensures that the layout is centered, and elements are spaced appropriately.

### JavaScript

- The core functionality of drawing, clearing, saving, and retrieving the signature is handled in the embedded `<script>` tags in the HTML file. It uses the Canvas API to enable drawing and manipulate the canvas elements.

## Future Enhancements

- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Enhance the user interface for better usability on mobile devices.
- **Signature Storage**: Implement server-side storage options for saving and retrieving signatures.
- **Multiple Signatures**: Allow users to create and manage multiple signatures.
- **Undo/Redo Functionality**: Add the ability to undo or redo strokes.
